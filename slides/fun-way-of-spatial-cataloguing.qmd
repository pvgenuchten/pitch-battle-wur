## A fun way to do spatial cataloguing

- we all know the edit-me-on-git link in modern websites/wikis
- anybody can contribute, contributions are traceable, easily restore if things break
- we want that experience for spatial cataloguing

## Some screenshots



## Intro to mcf / pygeometa



## CI-CD to publish to pycsw



## How is this percieved by the less-techy?

- Typical users expect shiny webforms, like linked-in, facebook
- Not used to YAML syntax and git CI-CD workflows
- That's  where the MDME initiative came up

## Land Soil Crop hubs

- An example of a catalogue using the MCF approach
- Collect resources which are relevant to agriculture in East Africa
- Users initially provided metadata as lists in excel
- Metadata is hosted in Github, users contribute content (and register issues)


## WMO Information System (WIS2)

- Set of tools adopted by regional weather offices to build up a global system

## Take aways

- MCF is an interesting metadata format for embedded metadata in local file repositories
- Git storage and CI-CD workflows are traceable, participatory approach for metadata management
- OGCAPI records (in for example pycsw) offers a clean machine and human friendly interfaceto metadata
