# Overview

Data Standards in the soil domain are quite elaborate, but adoption is low. 

- metadata 
- data standardisation 
- common code lists

The tools shoud be open source, supporting standards and easy to use. 

# Metadata

# Which metadata?

- Data describing datasets
- Title, Author, Usage constraints, Temporal extent, Provenance, Data model, ...

# Metadata and the soil domain

- Prediction of spatio temporal variation, soil degradation and crop yields require many types of data
- Data should be well documented to understand the relevance and the usage constraints of the derived products 
- Many data products have a spatio temporal aspect, so the standards of the Open GeoSpatial Consortium are most relevant. But compatibility with other standards is relevant also. 

# Metadata Current situation

- Not existing
- Not standardised; in a report or readme.txt file 
- Maintained in a catalogue; disconnected from data

# pygeometa, metadata for the rest of us

- A software library of the geopython community
- Every data file is accompanied by a structured metadata file
- YAML, easy to read by humans and machines
- A subset of the ISO19115 standard for metadata
- Exportable to variety of metadata standards (iso, dcat, stac)

# Tooling around the pygeometa library; pyGeoDataCrawler

- Scan a network folder for (meta)data
- Store metadata in a git repository
- Import metadata from excel or remote sources (harvest)

# Import into a catalogue; pycsw

- Metadata can be imported into a catalogue
- pycsw is a mid-size OGC reference catalog implementation
- pycsw uses a database backend (PostGreSQL)
- Various standardised API's (CSW, STAC, OAI-PMH) and models (Dublin Core, iso19115, Datacite)

# Data standardisation

# Initiatives

- Various initiatives developed models for interoperable soil observation data.
- Globalsoilmap, eSoter, iso28258, INSPIRE, Glosis-ld, SoilThings.
- For various reasons adoption has been low.
- Many initiatives are actually compatible, because they contain similar concepts. 
- Standardisation awareness is rising.

# SoilGPKG; A use case of soil data interoperability

Challenge: 

- The INSPIRE UML models and their GML serialisation are disconnected from data practices in the soil community, both for data providers and consumers

Solution: 

- A relational database model has been developed representing the UML classes of the INSPIRE schema. 

# SoilGPKG Usage

- The Geopackage can be shared as a portable database file. 
- A transformation solution is provided which can transform the data into the GML serialisation (Hale Studio).
- The resulting GML can be validated in the INSPIRE data validator
- The Geopackage can be easily displayed in Desktop GIS tools, such as QGIS

# SoilGPKG in EJP Soil

- Developed by Crea (IT) and Epsilon in the scope of EJPSoil
- Crea has loaded 1250 profiles into a GeoPackage
- Suggested as a good practice for sharing soil data in INSPIRE
- The relational model can also be used in PostGreSQL as a backend for actual applications.

# Common code lists

# Why endorse common code lists?

- Common referencable code lists are important, to facilitate interoperability in the soil domain
- Different providers can reference a universal definition of an entity
- Code lists for soil types, soil properties, soil property classes, soil analyses procedures, ... 
- References can be made from metadata as well as data


# Challenges with current code list repositories

- Agrovoc adopted an older version of WRB
- WRB itself does not host a code list repository
- INSPIRE registry did not populate the soil code lists 
- Glosis-ld codelists are not widely known and adopted (and not easy to use)

# At this conference

We hope to speak to you to design mechanisms to establish soil code list repositories which are recognised and easy to use.

# Thank you
