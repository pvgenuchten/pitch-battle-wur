## Setting: Data management in predictive modelling

- In `soil modelling`, we have many source and output data
    - field survey and lab data
    - covariates, eg. earth observation grids
    - model outputs
- These files are stored on a network drive accessible by HPC
    - The models are configured using workflows `versioned on GIT`
- Metadata management is `hard/dull/****`

## Concept: the sidecar file

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Use where possible `embedded metadata` on your data files 
    - Add additional metadata on a sidecar file
- Set up a crawler which extracts metadata from your file repositories
    - Crawled records are placed in a searchable index

## Tools: pygeometa & geodatacrawler

- [pygeometa](https://github.com/geopython/pygeometa)'s MCF is a minimal subset of iso19115, encoded in yaml (optimal for Git versioning)
- [geodatacrawler](https://pypi.org/project/geodatacrawler/) extends pygeometa to: 
    - extract metadata from data formats
    - inherit metadata from parent folders
    - import metadata from csv and remote sources
    - create data api's based on metadata
- [![](./img/pycsw-logo.png){height="50" style="vertical-align:middle"}](https://pycsw.org) is a pythonic catalogue web app. Wide standards support enables discovery in multiple communities.
