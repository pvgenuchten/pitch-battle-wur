## Improving findability - devops style 

- What: Document your modelling data with minimal effort
- Why: Better findability and (re)usability of data
- What's next: Adopt the efforts in ongoing projects & extend the user community

## Setting & Concept

- Setting: Data management in predictive modelling
    - In `soil modelling` we handle many data sources
    - These files are stored on a network drive
    - Metadata management is `complex/dull/****`
- The sidecar concept
    - Add minimal metadata on a sidecar file
    - A crawler extracts metadata from a file repository
    - Crawled records are placed in a searchable index

## pygeometa, geodatacrawler & pycsw

- [pygeometa](https://github.com/geopython/pygeometa)'s MCF is a minimal subset of ISO19115, encoded in yaml 
- [geodatacrawler](https://pypi.org/project/geodatacrawler/) extends pygeometa to: 
    - extract metadata from data formats
    - inherit metadata from parent folders
    - import metadata from csv and remote sources
    - create data api's based on metadata
- [![](https://demo.pycsw.org/gisdata/static/logo-horizontal.png){height="50" style="vertical-align:middle"}](https://pycsw.org) is a pythonic catalogue web app. Wide standards support enables findability in multiple communities.
